# Blockchain-Innovation-News-Blog-Project
This project was my final project for CS2300. I made a Blockchain Innovation blog site that is fully interactive. While the website is not published, feel free to clone the project and run it locally if you want to view some out of data blockchain innovation

Note: Do not get caught up on the content, the point of this website to practice interactive/dynamic website development.
